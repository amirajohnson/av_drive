AV Drive is a self-driving car simulation created by Amira Johnson.

-- description 
AV Drive is a self-driving car simulator that uses Breadth-First and Depth-First 
Search algorithms to navigate a busy parking lot! Users can place pedestrians
and bicycles into the parking lot, and when the space key is pressed, the AV 
must develop a path to navigate the parking lot. 

-- how to run AV Drive
Put cmu_cs3_graphics in the same folder as AV Drive and run the 
AVDriveTP-UpdatedGraphics.py

-- libraries
No libraries need to be installed to play AV Drive!

-- shortcut commands
To play AV Drive, place obstacles onto the board -- chosen by clicking 'n' for 
pedestrians or 'b' for bicycles. Then, press the spacebar to watch the AV 
navigate the parking lot. Finally, when the AV reaches its goal, press 'R' to 
play again! 
Note: when the spacebar is pressed, if there is no path to the goal,
the screen will automatically refresh.
