# AV Drive
This project was written in the Spring 2022 as a term project submission for the 15-112 course.

Welcome to AV Drive!

This project is the first major (solo) python project that I wrote as a freshman in college.

AV Drive is a self-driving car simulator that uses modified Breadth-First and Depth-First 
Search algorithms to navigate a busy parking lot! Users can place pedestrians, trucks
and bicycles into the parking lot, and when the space key is pressed, the AV 
determines a path to navigate the parking lot. 

-- libraries
cmu_cs3_graphics is needed to run AV drive.
  - link to library: https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/

-- how to run AV Drive
Put cmu_cs3_graphics in the same folder as AV Drive and run the 
AVDriveTP-UpdatedGraphics.py


-- shortcut commands
To play AV Drive, place obstacles onto the board -- chosen by clicking 'n' for 
pedestrians or 'b' for bicycles. Then, press the spacebar to watch the AV 
navigate the parking lot. Finally, when the AV reaches its goal, press 'R' to 
play again! 
Note: when the spacebar is pressed, if there is no path to the goal,
the screen will automatically refresh.
